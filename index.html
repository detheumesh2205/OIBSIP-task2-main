                with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely 
                referred to as the "People's President",he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public 
                service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's 
                highest civilian honour.
